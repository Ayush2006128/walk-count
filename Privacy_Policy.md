# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** December 17, 2025

WalkCount ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our WalkCount Android application collects, uses, and safeguards your information.

## 1. Information Collection and Use

### Physical Activity Data
The App uses the `ACTIVITY_RECOGNITION` permission to access your device's built-in step counter sensor. This sensor data is used solely to:
*   Calculate and display your daily step count.
*   Track your progress towards the daily goals you set within the App.

This processing happens entirely locally on your device in real-time.

### User Preferences
We store your daily step goal locally on your device using Android's DataStore Preferences. This allows the App to remember your goal between sessions.

## 2. Data Storage and Sharing

**No Data is Uploaded:**
WalkCount is an offline-first application. We do **not** collect, transmit, or store your personal data, step counts, or usage habits on any external servers. All data remains strictly on your device.

**Third-Party Sharing:**
Since we do not collect any personal data, we do not share, sell, or disclose your information to any third parties.

## 3. Permissions

To function as intended, the App requires the following permissions:

*   **Physical Activity (`ACTIVITY_RECOGNITION`):** Required to access the step sensor.
*   **Foreground Service (`FOREGROUND_SERVICE`, `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_HEALTH`):** Required to count steps accurately while the App is running in the background.
*   **Notifications (`POST_NOTIFICATIONS`):** Required to show a persistent notification with your current step count while the service is running.

## 4. Children’s Privacy

Our App does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. As the App does not collect any personal information whatsoever, this applies to all users.

## 5. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
